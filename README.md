# Jets Project

### Description

The goal is to create a fleet of jets with different capabilities. This app will have a menu to use our jets and access information about them. The initial batch of jets is imported through a CSV file. The file is parsed and used to create Objects of abstract type/class Jet, however, we have some interfaces and subclasses that dictate what type of jet they are (and what the can do with their methods).

### Technologies Used
OO in general is shown here more than ever before. Use of List interfaces, polymorphism, inheritance, and UML come to mind.

### Lessons Learned
Much more experience from this project accessing the elements/Objects in the List interface.
